# Enter Sentry

Our Goal: 

We are Sentry. We are a team of videogame enthusiasts with the desire to protect our precious videogames. We are a business-to-business company spearheaded by Marianna with support from Hugo, Yusef, and Joshua. Our goal is to make videogame makers comfortable enough to be able to produce and maintain their games by protecting their games from piracy. Our service will promote stability to our virtual realms and will help build and maintain their entertainment in the long run.  We offer contractual and subscription based service. 

How?

We will protect their stored information and monitor their servers as they continue their videogaming work. We offer Best-in-the-World service to the top companies in the industry, such as Steam and EpicGames. We will help keep information safe and private as it is ethically correct and companies have the right to earn money from their craft. 

Why this?

We all should understand the importance of data security. These businesses are always under threat and are being attacked by hackers. There is a looming threat of being hacked and having information stolen, which includes games being pirated. The issue that they face as all companies face now, are problems with security. These companies compromise the relationship with their customers and lose money when they are not protected. Enter Sentry; we will provide the necessary tools of people, hardware and software they will need for protection. 

What is to be gained?  

We are extemely passionate about making gaming safe from piracy and liken ourselves to our favorite videogame protaginists who take part in a noble and epic quest to defeat evil forces who would dare pirate our precious games. 
We hold the protection of property, intellectual or others very dear. 

What do we offer?

We offer data security solutions to gaming platforms. We have started development and testing will continue to ensure our services remain  consistent. We can start integrating it into the platforms on a small scale and if necessary will find and swiftly remove any, for the most part unlikely faults. We are very strong at preventing attacks and are able to nullify any encountered threat and help fix and breached items.
- We will continue to monitor and will not allow any breaches on our watch.
- We constantly update our policies, procedures, and technology often so that we can meet the new challenges that hackers create everyday. 
- We offer many solutions of variable pricing that should suit most individual firms needs as we understand every firm has different needs. We offer competent services at competitive fees. 
-Our data security solutions will be available primarily through software and will be of greatest value to videogaming companies.

Why are we different?

We understand that developers need to have their games protected from piracy but we must also keep their constomers in mind. We want to make sure they can enjoy their games without our software causing performance issues or requiring an internet connection to constantly check-in. Its a tough challenge to accomplish this, but its one that we continue to work hard on and adapt to with new developments and techniques being implemented when we roll out our updates. Not one problem out of the several we face is the same so being able to adapt is the key to our success. While we talk about protecting the companies making the games, we also understand how important it is to protect the information of those playing the games as well. With several hacks gathering very sensitive information on the people that play the games, we also offer software to companies that protect their consumers. Being a well rounded company that can take on several issues is what will keep us ahead of the competition.


Our specific customer segment will be gaming platforms. Examples of these would be Steam and EpicGames, still there are more out there and as videogaming beomes more popular we expect the target audience to expand. These are two companies previously mentioned very popular platforms for purchasing videogames. Steam has approximately around 30,000 games and the other platforms as expected to have numbers around there. These companies can make between 10-50 million dollars per game that is being sold.   So with price being an issue only lose money if a game is not bought but also potential buyers as they will have a negative reputation. They overall can miss millions of dollars in revenue, so this is a problem that would want to be resolved as quickly as possible.
