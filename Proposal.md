# Enter Sentry

**Our Goal:**
We are Sentry. We are a team of video game enthusiasts with the desire to protect our precious video games. We are a business-to-business company spearheaded by Marianna with support from Hugo, Yusef, and Joshua. Our goal is to make video game developers comfortable enough to be able to produce and maintain their games by protecting their games from piracy. We will also provide those developers with tools to protect the people that enjoy playing their games. Our service will promote stability to our virtual realms and will help build and maintain their entertainment in the long run. We offer a subscription based model with different tiers.

**How?**
- We will protect their stored information and monitor their platforms as they continue their development.
- We offer Best-in-the-World service to the top companies in the industry, such as Steam and EpicGames.
- We will help keep information private as it is ethically correct and companies have the right to earn money from their craft. 

**Why this?**
- We all should understand the importance and of data security as well as the problems companies are exposed to.
- These businesses are always under threat and are being attacked by hackers which can get away with customer information and piracy.
- These companies compromise the relationship with their customers and lose money when they are not protected.
- Enter Sentry; we will provide the necessary resources of people, hardware and software they will need for protection. 

**What is to be gained?**  
- Peace of mind, not only for the companies but for the gamers as well. We understand the hard work that goes into developing these games so they have the right to have that work protected and collect a reward from it.
- Trust, gamers trust these developers with sensitive information that needs to be prtected and a stronger sense of security will strengthen that trust.

**What do we offer?**
We offer data security solutions to gaming platforms and developers. We have started development and testing will continue to ensure our services remain  consistent. We can start integrating it into the platforms on a small scale and if necessary will find and swiftly remove any, for the most part unlikely faults. We are very strong at preventing attacks and are able to nullify any encountered threat and help fix and breached items.
- We will continue to monitor and will not allow any breaches on our watch.
- We constantly update our policies, procedures, and technology often so that we can meet the new challenges that hackers create everyday. 
- We offer many solutions of variable pricing that should suit most individual firms needs as we understand every firm has different needs. 
- We offer competent services at competitive fees. 
- Our data security solutions will be available primarily through software and will be of greatest value to videogaming companies.

**Why are we different?**
We understand that developers need to have their games protected from piracy but we must also keep their constomers in mind.
- For the Companies:
  + Being able to protect the developer's games will allow for allocation of resources in creating better games with fewer bugs and deliver an overall better experience.
  + After the game release, instead of worrying about being pirated, development can start on additional content or updates.
 - For the Gamers:
  + With several hacks gathering very sensitive information on the people that play the games, we also offer software to companies that protect their consumers.
  + We want to make sure they can enjoy their games without our software causing performance issues or requiring an internet connection to constantly check-in.
- Being a well rounded company that can take on several problems and adapt to them efficiently while keeping both parties in mind is what will keep us ahead of the competition.

**Our Customer** 

Our specific customer segment will be gaming platforms. Examples of these would be Steam and EpicGames, still there are more out there and as video games become more popular we expect the target audience to expand. The two companies previously mentioned are very popular platforms for purchasing video games. Steam has approximately around 30,000 games and the other platforms are expected to have numbers around there. These companies can make between 10-50 million dollars per game that is being sold. So with price being an issue only lose money if a game is not bought but also potential buyers as they will have a negative reputation. They overall can miss millions of dollars in revenue, so this is a problem that would want to be resolved as quickly as possible.
