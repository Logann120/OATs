It cost money to startup business, here is a simple sketch of Sentry startup capital.Business funding options

Sentry is a startup Limited liability Company L.L.C. it falls under the category of a service provider. For us to estimate how much funds we need to startup our business, we need to calculate the startup costs so that we request funding, attract investors and estimate when we’ll turn a profit. Calculating our startup costs help us to:
o	Estimate profits
o	Attract investors
o	Secure loans
o	Save money with tax deductions
o	Do breakeven analysis

Our financing options are only handful. The company need finance for the following:
One-time expenses
•	legal registration processes such as licenses and permits
•	Running up testes
•	Equipment and supplies
•	Making a website
We can typically deduct one-time expenses for tax purpose at the end the end of the year.
Recurring expenditure/ Monthly expenses
•	Hiring software engineers and developers,
•	Finding host servers
•	Advertising and marketing
•	Communications
•	Lawyer and accountant

Self-funding
Our startup funding comes from bootstrapping, we the owners of the business need to tap into our own financial resources to support our business. self-funding involves using our own savings, turning to family and friends or tapping into our own 401ks. The advantage of self-funding is we can control the business completely but bear the risk alone. To avoid the trap of failure and facing expensive penalties for tapping into our 401ks, we need a financial adviser.

Business loans
The best option available is to apply for the government loan program, this is because banks and financial institutions loan require assets to act as a guarantee for startup and expansion of businesses, which Sentry, as of now, does not have. The good news is, government loan finance Sentry directly, in addition, government loan provide guarantee for additional finances.
Our loan package needs to be discussed with the participating lender/ either Wheels Fargo or First national Bank, whichever qualifies for a government guarantee. This guarantee portion represent the amount the government will repay in case sentry fail to meet their financial obligation to the bank in question. The likelihood of securing a loan from financial institutions is increased by the guarantee from the government.
