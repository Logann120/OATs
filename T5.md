**Mission:** Each team needs to provide a complete financial plan consisting of cost structure and revenue streams.

Team Leader: Yusuf

**Task:** Specify the cost structure: list the required start-up funds, as well as the ongoing operating expenses, including estimated costs of business overhead, of operations and of providing goods & services. Be certain to include costs related to customer relationships and channels, key activities and resources (including the IT Platform), and the costs of providing your value propositions.

Start up funds: 
marketing
Legal fees for advice
website fees

Ongoing operation: 
Employee wages
Up keep from the servers we moniter

Cost of providing goods:
Maintaining the software
customer service channels

**Task:** Specify the revenue streams: provide the projected sales volume and associated revenues, as well as other sources of income and associated revenues. Consider all relevant types of revenue streams for your organization.

Our major source of income would be the businesses buying our software which would be a large amount since it would be a one time purchase. We also offer a premium service that would be maintained, and would appeal to most customers. Our clients are busy and already have so much to do that paying a monthly subscription fee and not worrying about any errors would be of great value. 

**Task:** Based on cost structure and revenue streams, put together a financial plan: for a three-year period, project the online businesses finances. Conclude with an assessment of the financial viability of the online business. You can find examples online. Here is an excellent blog that gives information some information on how to do this - https://blog.statsbot.co/excel-for-startups-simple-financial-models-and-dashboards-2b7c99580992 (

It cost money to startup a business, here is a simple sketch of Sentry startup capital and business funding options.

Sentry is a startup Limited Liability Company L.L.C. and it falls under the category of a service provider. For us to estimate how much funds we need to startup our business, we need to calculate the startup costs so that we can request funding, attract investors and estimate when weâ€™ll turn a profit. Calculating our startup costs help us to:

  - Estimate profits
  - Attract investors
  - Secure loans
  - Save money with tax deductions
  - Do breakeven analysis

Our financing options are only handful. The company need finance for the following:

| One-time Expenses|
| :----------------: |
| Licenses and Permits |
| Running Up Tests |
| Equipment and Supplies |
| Making a Website |

| Recurring Expenditure/Monthly Expenses |
| :---------------------------------------: |
| Hiring Software Engineers and Developers |
| Finding Host Servers |
| Advertising and Marketing |
| Communications |
| Lawyer |
| Accountant |

Most support activities are also tax deductible. 

Self-funding
Our startup funding comes from bootstrapping, we as the owners of the business need to tap into our own financial resources to support our business. Self-funding involves using our own savings, turning to family and friends or tapping into our own resources. The advantage of self-funding is we can control the business completely but bear the risk alone. To avoid the trap of failure and facing expensive penalties for tapping into our financial resources, we need a financial adviser.

Business loans
The best option available is to apply for the government loan program, this is because banks and financial institutions loan require assets to act as a guarantee for startup and expansion of businesses, which Sentry, as of now, does not have. The good news is, government loan finance Sentry directly, in addition, government loan provide guarantee for additional finances.
Our loan package needs to be discussed with the participating lender/ either Wheels Fargo or First national Bank, whichever qualifies for a government guarantee. This guarantee portion represent the amount the government will repay in case sentry fail to meet their financial obligation to the bank in question. The likelihood of securing a loan from financial institutions is increased by the guarantee from the government.
