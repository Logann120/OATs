Sentry Business Partners

Business partners basically are commercial entities with which Sentry has some form of alliance most probably based on contractual relationship. The partner in most cases provide services that allow Sentry to execute its operations swiftly. 
  - cloud providers
  - integration and maintenance
  - application service providers.

**Task:** For each business partner, consider whether they provide goods or access to resources, whether they provide services or perform key activities, or if they help us reduce costs or risks.

  - The cloud service providers will be able to provide an avenue for our clients to use our services and provide more computing power.
  - We will also use equipment procured from our suppliers and other outsourced softwares when it is cost-efficient and more secure to    use.

**Task:** Develop the Website Concept: a mock-up of the website for the on-line aspect of the business, developed either in a page-layout or drawing program. Include in this design the layout, content, and artwork of several actual site/application pages (include at least 4 or 5 fully designed pages). These pages need to show key activities (i.e. not just about pages).
