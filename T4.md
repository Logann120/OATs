Serevices and Business Partners

  - The cloud service providers will be able to provide an avenue for our clients to use our services and provide more computing power when needed for any models that we might have to do or when handling big data.
  - Since we are building some servers in house for more private information, partnering with hardware companies would be a large benefit since they would be providing access to a valuable and reliable resource.
  - Having to be in constant communication with team members about any changes that might happen in development, if something suddenly stops working in production, or if a client needs anything will require reliable communication so partnering with a trustworthy cell phone provider will be crucial service.
  - We will also use equipment procured from our suppliers and other outsourced softwares when it is cost-efficient and more secure to    use.
