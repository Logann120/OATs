**Background:** You are now part of a small and agile team of entrepreneurs who perceive of modern information and communications technologies as means of economic prosperity and community development.

**Mission:** Each team needs to identify the key activities and key resources for the online business. Ensure that the activities and resources fit your customer segments, value propositions, channels, and customer relationships.

**Task:** Select team leader for current assignment.

**Task:** First identify the key activities for creating your value propositions. Will you be developing physical or digital products? Will you be solving customer problems? Will you develop and maintain a platform for customers to use?
 
We will be develoing a digital service. Our service being a software that can be implemented into there platforms. We would be solving a huge problem that these platforms are currently facing. We will glading develop it to fit their custom needs. Still they have the option to do it themselves. For an extra fee we would could maintian it and help them with any errors that would arise. We would prefer to maintain and help the customer with the software as we care about protection of their customers and the produts. 

**Task:** Next list the key resources required to make your business model work. Consider physical, intellectual, human, and financial assets. Identify whether you would own these resources, rent or lease them, or acquire them through business partners.
 
 We would need a team of software developers to creat the product it self as well as the idea of what and how the software would be. This being much more complex than it ounds. We would need a good amoutn of money as creating software is not as easy feat. As well as connections and access to the platforms and servers of these companies. We would create the software which would use our own resources but wouldnt need much physical mterial for the sucess ofthe company. We would need to acquire information from our business partners as the sysytem would be integrated into theirs and we would want it to be customized to fit their needs. 

**Task:** A key resource for an online business is its use of technology. Consider hardware, software, databases, and data communications. Based on this, develop the Information Technology Platform: a description of the computing and communications equipment and software your new organization needs to operate. This includes not only the equipment for the website, but also the technology to run the business processes and the business administration. 
 
 Our business would need to have the software. To implment it we would need a servers to implemnt the software but these servers would most likely. We would eed the software as well as a channel to contact our cusotmers with any concerns that they might have. AS stated preferably we maintain the system and we can work with at a persoanl level, but if that is not suited to theri processes we could create a website so they have contact with us.
