T3

**Background:** You are now part of a small and agile team of entrepreneurs who perceive of modern information and communications technologies as means of economic prosperity and community development.

**Mission:** Each team needs to identify the key activities and key resources for the online business. Ensure that the activities and resources fit your customer segments, value propositions, channels, and customer relationships.

**Task:** Select team leader for current assignment.

**Task:** First identify the key activities for creating your value propositions. Will you be developing physical or digital products? Will you be solving customer problems? Will you develop and maintain a platform for customers to use?
 
We will be developing a digital service. Our service being a software that can be implemented into their platforms. While the product is digital we will be providing both digital and physical services (mentioned in T2). Piracy is a major dilemma that a lot of these online platforms face so stopping that issue is going to be our number one priority. Another problem is being able to detect where the breach is coming from, so not only are we helping the one company while it happens, if we can find the origin of the attacka and apprehend the people behind it, we will be helping our other customers fro potential attacks as well. Since we are making the platform that inegrates into their platform, everything we see (except for our alogrthims and coding) they will be able to see. Obviously, any errors in our platform, we will handle ourselves since we want to provide a product that is smooth to operate. If they feel comfortable enough to handle the platform themselves they can but we will also offer services to maintin it for them (included in a more expensive package). Since we made the product and know it so well, we would hope that they would like for us to maintain it for them as well. So if they want to revamp their existing platform, they can handle the implemenation of our product into their their new platform or we can handle that for them.

**Task:** Next list the key resources required to make your business model work. Consider physical, intellectual, human, and financial assets. Identify whether you would own these resources, rent or lease them, or acquire them through business partners.
 
We would need a team of software developers and engineers to create the product as well as the idea of what and how the software would be implemented. Cryptographers are going to be major part of our team so they can develop a strong security. Starting off small, we can go with the option of working remote so we can save money by not renting offices but we will still need space for servers and engineers to build those servers. All of this will recquire money as well and the appropriate financial personnel to handle it as well. Network engineers are going to be important as well to be able to view traffic as well as maintaining the connection and servers. We would need to acquire information from our business partners as the sysytem would be integrated into theirs and we would want it to be customized to fit their needs.

**Task:** A key resource for an online business is its use of technology. Consider hardware, software, databases, and data communications. Based on this, develop the Information Technology Platform: a description of the computing and communications equipment and software your new organization needs to operate. This includes not only the equipment for the website, but also the technology to run the business processes and the business administration. 

Upfront, our largest expenses are going to come in the form of providing the hardware all of programmers need as well as the hardware needed to build the servers and databases. Since we will offer work remote, we will want our developers too have very reliable hardware. We will also need to pay for software such at GitHub Enterpise for team communication on our programming. Something like Terraform would be great as well so in case something goes wrong due to some bad code or accidental changes causing our software to break, we can roll back the changes and be able to see where the problem came from. Slack Enterprise will also be a valuable tool to have for meetings and updates. We will need to have the appropriate software to handle our finances (expenses, payroll, etc) as well. For the employees that handle any problems that our customers might have, we will need to get them cell phones/plans so they can be reached on the go as well. A website is something that will also be needed to provide information (updates, new products, etc) to new customers as well as existing customers.
