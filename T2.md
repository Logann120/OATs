# Channels and Customers

Team Leader:  **Mariana Perez**

Our customers would be the businesses themselves, it would be very difficult to connect to them through social media. 
- Connect to us through a private platform or through our website.

We have also already networked with various industry insiders. 
- We hope to be able to convince some of the smaller platforms at first.
- Then larger companies will notice that we are doing something great with our service/product and will want to do business with us.
- "Word of mouth" will hopefully allow us to get our foot in the door with the larger companies and allow us to expand and grow.

We will have several packages available on our website
- Different price points so they can see how much service they want along with the features that will meet their business needs.
- Higher packages will have 24/7 support.

Obviously being online, an attack can come at any point and we will be prepared to face them at any time of the day. Being able to respond quickly along with efficient tracking will put us ahead of the competition. Any data that we get will also be analyzed and will help us improve our product.

We would regularly contact the customers with any concerns, this would be easy because we would maintain the service and be prepared for anything.
- Intercommunication platform that would allow them to ask any questions
- Get answers within 30 minutes because of the urgency that cyber security creates and we know that if a security breach or any errors aren't solved soon, it could lead into much bigger problems.

We want our clients to know that we are very proactive.
- We will be able to constantly monitor their systems and if there are patterns of an attack.
- We will try to get ahead of them and stop it before it happens.
- When there are certain cybersecurity events going on the world, we can adjust to them and roll out a defense against those issues quickly and efficiently. 
- We will have automated services that can collect data for our analytics which will be openly available to our customers as well.

We want our customers to feel protected and will offer both on-site and remote service when implementing systems. Any large updates that will add new features that they need to know how to use, a person on-site will also be able to help them with any questions they have. Having a face-to-face option is always more comforting when learning something new. Any hotfixes and small updates can be implemented remotely online. 
  
Ways to improve for Customers:
  
Sentry’s initial marketing strategy is to sell our product to smaller gaming companies and then aim for larger platforms. 
After the second quarter of our first year in the business: 
- We’ll evaluate our overall performance.
- Conduct a demographic research to determine how our customers feel and think about our product.
  
We also need to cross examine potential competitors in our market niche, determine how our company differ from competitors with special emphasis in our unique selling proposition (USP). USP characteristics makes Sentry stand out, giving it an advantage to device our next marketing strategy, messages, campaign, and programs for expanding the business and appealing to the giants in the gaming market. 
  
Sentry marketing mediums are handful, since the only means available to reach to our potential customers is our set website, Sentry would fully take advantage of gaming shows and exhibitions where potential clients sell their products, setting up posts, handing out broachers.
