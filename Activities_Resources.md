# Key Activities and Resources
**Team Leader: Mariana Perez**
 
 **Key Activities**
 
**People and Location:**
- We need a team of software developers and engineers to create the product as well as the idea of what and how the software would be implemented.
- Network engineers are important as to be able to view web traffic as well as maintaining the connection and servers.
- Cryptographers are a major part of our team so we can develop a strong security team. 
- Starting off small, we can go with the option of working remote so we can save money by not renting offices, but we will still need space for servers and engineers.
- All of this will require capital as well and the appropriate financial personnel to handle it.
- We need to acquire information from our business partners as the system would be integrated into theirs and we would want it to be customized to fit their needs.

**Software:**
- GitHub Enterpise for team communication on our programming projects. 
- Terraform would be great as well so in case something goes wrong due to some bad code or accidental changes causing our software to break, we can roll back the changes and be able to see where the problem came from. 
- Slack Enterprise will also be a valuable tool to have for meetings and updates. 
- We will need to have the appropriate software to handle our human resources, administration and other support roles such as expenses and payroll. 

**Hardware:**
- Our largest expense is providing reliable hardware for the programmer's needs and the hardware needed to build the servers and databases.
- Since we will offer work remote, we will want our developers to have very reliable internet which is expensive and we will cover 50% of the cost.
- For the employees that handle any problems that our customers might have, we will need to provide cell phones and plans so they can communicate on the go as well as other necessary tools.
- As we are a startup we will rely on our teams to use their own dwelling, however for face-to-face meetings we will rent a boardroom at the Hilton.
- A website will also be needed to provide information (updates, new products, etc) to new customers as well as existing customers.
- We will use a .com domain for starters and as we grow into more countries we will acquire the appropiate top-level domain. 
- We will obtain website hosting service from web.com because they will keep costs the low and will outsource our identity software to Auth0 until we can build our own. Auth0 offers a very secure cloud and credentialing service that will keep our data and secure.

**Key Resources**

Our service is a software that can be implemented into their platforms. The product is digital and we will also be providing physical services (mentioned in T2). Piracy is a major dilemma that a lot of online platforms face so stopping that issue is our number one priority. Another problem is the ability to detect where the breach is coming from. We can help multiple companies simultaneously if we can find the origin of the attack and apprehend the people behind it, to save our other clients from potential attacks as well.

Since we are making the software that integrates into their platform, everything we see (except for our algorithms and coding) they will be able to see. Obviously, any errors in our platform, we will handle ourselves since we want to provide a product that is easy to operate. If they feel comfortable enough to handle the platform theirselves they will be able to, but we will also offer services to maintain it for them (included in a more expensive package). 

Considering that we made the product and know it so well, we would hope that they would like for us to maintain it for them as well. We allow flexibility to revamp their existing platform by enabling them to handle the implemenation of our product into their their new platform or we can handle that for them.
