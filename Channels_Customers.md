# Channels and Customers

**Team Leader: Mariana Perez**

Our customers would be the businesses themselves, it would be very difficult to connect to them through social media. Obviously being online, an attack can come at any point and we will be prepared to face them at any time of the day. Being able to respond quickly along with efficient tracking will put us ahead of the competition. Any data that we get will also be analyzed and will help us improve our product.

**We have already networked with various industry insiders.**
1. We hope to be able to convince some of the smaller platforms at first.
2. Larger companies will notice that we are doing something great with our service/product and will want to do business with us.
3. Through "word of mouth" we will get our foot in the door with the rest of the larger companies and allow us to expand and grow.

**We will have several packages available on our website.**
- Different price points so they can see how much service they want along with the features that will meet their business needs.
- Higher packages will have 24/7 support.

**We would keep a regular contact with our customers, specially if they have any concerns.**
- They can connect to use directly through our **website** via a private chat or open a ticket.
- Intercommunication via private platform that would allow them to ask any questions.
- Get answers within 30 minutes because of the urgency that cyber security creates and we know that if a security breach or any errors aren't solved soon, it could lead into much bigger problems.
- During times of emergencies, they can contact us through our phones and someone **will** answer.

**We want our customers to know that we are very proactive.**
- We will be able to constantly monitor their systems and if there are patterns of an attack.
- We will try to get ahead of them and stop it before it happens.
- When there are certain cybersecurity events going on the world, we can adjust to them and roll out a defense against those issues quickly and efficiently. 
- We will have automated services that can collect data for our analytics which will be openly available to our customers as well.


**We want our customers to feel comfortable and will offer both on-site and remote service when implementing systems.**
- Any large updates that will add new features that they need to know how to use, a person on-site will also be able to help them with any questions they have. Having a face-to-face option is always more comforting when learning something new.
- Any hotfixes and small updates can be implemented remotely online.
  
**Ways to improve for our customers:**

Sentry’s initial marketing strategy is to sell our product to smaller gaming companies and then aim for larger platforms. 
After the second quarter of our first year in the business: 
- We’ll evaluate our overall performance.
- Conduct a demographic research to determine how our customers feel and think about our product.
  
We also need to cross examine potential competitors in our market niche, determine how our company differ from competitors with special emphasis in our unique selling proposition (USP). USP characteristics makes Sentry stand out, giving it an advantage to device our next marketing strategy, messages, campaign, and programs for expanding the business and appealing to the giants in the gaming market. 
  
Sentry marketing mediums are handful, since the only means available to reach to our potential customers is our set website, Sentry would fully take advantage of gaming shows and exhibitions where potential clients sell their products, setting up posts, handing out broachers.
